There are two libraries that you may have to import before making the project:

* [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.syncthemall/boilerpipe/1.2.1 Boilerpipe]
* [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.jsoup/jsoup/1.8.3 Jsoup]

Please first, create the project from IdeaJ by opening this folder, and open the [Project Structure] (Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S), select the "Libraries", choose "Add" >> "From Maven..." and find them all, download, and make the project.
